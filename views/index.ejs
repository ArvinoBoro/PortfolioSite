                        <p>I am an IT enthusiast who is seeking to expand my professional experience. 
                            What youâ€™re looking at is my portfolio website, which showcases my projects, skills, education, and objectives. 
                            You can also find me on GitHub and LinkedIn. 
                            I know this page is somewhat sparse but I couldn't think of anything else to add.  
                            Feel free to make any suggestions through the contact page.</p>
                        <p>Thanks!</p>
