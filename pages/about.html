                    <p>Hey hey!
                        My name is Arvin Ziba. 
                        I am a second-year student at Ontario Tech University, majoring in networking and IT security. 
                        From my studies there, I gained a solid grasp in most of the content covered in CCNA plus about 85 hours of practical experience, through our state-of-the-art networking lab. 
                        I also have a plenty of experience in programming in Python, C++, and JavaScript (more so in Python) from my courses in programming concepts in Python, data structures and algorithms, web and script programming, and statistics. 
                        Below is a list of some of my completed courses at Ontario Tech. 
                        I encourage you check out my “Projects” page for more insight into my professional experience. 
                        My hobbies include Dungeons and Dragons, other board games, video games, and hacking. 
                        Hacking is a big one. 
                        I have a passion for experimenting with networks and seek ways to breach their security (legally, of course). 
                        This is something I do on my home lab hope to turn this into a career in cybersecurity.
                        Anyways, that’s a little about myself. Thanks for reading.
