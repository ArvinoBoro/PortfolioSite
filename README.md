# PortfolioSite

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repo!

## Project Overview
This is my second-year university project for Web and Script Programming at Ontario Tech University (formerly University of Ontario Institute of Technology). The project is a **portfolio website** designed to showcase my professional skills to job recruiters and anyone interested in my work.

## Project Status
This project is hosted live at https://arvinoboro.github.io/PortfolioSite/index.html. 

Once the site is complete, future commits will:
- Address any issues.
- Update portfolio content.
- Enhance functionality.
