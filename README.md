# PortfolioSite

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repo!

## Project Overview
This is my second-year university project for Web and Script Programming at Ontario Tech University (formerly University of Ontario Institute of Technology). The project is a **portfolio website** designed to showcase my professional skills to job recruiters and anyone interested in my work.

## Project Status
The website is currently under development and will be hosted live by October 4, 2024. The URI for the live site will be provided in this document once available. 

Once the site is complete, future commits will:
- Address any issues.
- Update portfolio content.
- Enhance functionality.
