# PortfolioSite
v2.0.4

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repo!

## Project Overview
This is my second-year university project for Web and Script Programming at Ontario Tech University (formerly University of Ontario Institute of Technology). The project is a **portfolio website** designed to showcase my professional skills to job recruiters and anyone interested in my work.

## Project Status
v2.0.0 is currently in development and for that reason is temporarily unhosted. 

Once the site is complete, future commits will:
- Address any issues.
- Update portfolio content.
- Enhance functionality.

## How to Contact Me
Feel free to leave any comments, suggestions, or inquiries either on GitHub or through email at [arvin.ziba@ontariotechu.net](mailto:arvin.ziba@ontariotechu.net).
